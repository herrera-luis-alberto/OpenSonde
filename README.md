OpenSondeBus
------------

OpenSondeBus (OSB) is the core of open sonde as it allows several devices to
communicate. The bus defines a connection layout, communication protocol and
powering system. OSB communication protocol is a standard I2C. This makes
extremely for hobbyist to integrate devices to OSB. In fact, any I2C device
just need some wiring to be OSB compatible.
